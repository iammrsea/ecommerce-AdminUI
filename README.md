# Admin and Customer Dashboard UI for an e-commerce website

This project is the implementation of the Admin UI and Customer Dashboard of this website [We Do Your Farm](wedoyourfarm.netlify.com).

It consists primarily of two branches:

- master
- customer dashboard

I dervied the Admin UI and the Customer Dashboard UI builds from the master branch and customer dashboard branch respectively,
and served the both from statically generated [NuxtJs Frontend](https://github.com/iammrsea/ecommerce).
The two branches are the same codebase, but with different routing files for each branch.

The styling was done using [Materializecss](https://materializecss.com), a class-based materialized styling.
However,I turned the classes (the ones I used mostly in the project) into React reusable components to fit into
React's component-based philosophy.
